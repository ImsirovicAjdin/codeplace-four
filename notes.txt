INSTALLING BOOTSTRAP

Step 1
We will be using our favourite Front-End framework of choice, bootstrap!

Head over to the seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails gem documentation on Github, and take a short look at the instructions. When you're done, we'll add the gem to our gemfile and run the bundle install command. 
https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails

./gemfile.rb
gem 'twitter-bootstrap-rails', :git => 'git://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails.git'

 we could also just use 'bundle' to substitute 'bundle install'

Step 2
As noticed in the documentation, we need to run a generator for us to install bootstrap. We want to specify the use of static files for our app.

rails g bootstrap:install static

Step 3
Save our work, commit it to Github.

git commit -m "Install bootstrap"

INSTALL FONTAWESOME

Step 1
To add some more awesome styling power in our application, we are going to use Icons. 
And one of the best assets out there is 'font-awesome'. 

Check out the documentation for the bokmann/font-awesome-rails gem, and if you did, add it to the gemfile and run bundle. 
https://github.com/bokmann/font-awesome-rails

Step 2
Open the gemfile, and add the gem to the bottom.

bundle

Step 3
And the best part is, that we only have to add one line to the applications.css assets pipeline in order for the font-awesome to work! 
./app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
<<EOF
 *
 *= require_tree .
 *= require font-awesome
 *= require_self
 */
 
Step 4
Save our work, and push it up to Github. 
git commit -m "Added Font-Awesome"

INSTALL SIMPLE FORM

Step 1
Great apps have great forms! Lucky for us, there is an awesome gem from the hero's of Plataformatec that have simplified our life and standardizing a lot of work for us. 
Go to the plataformatec/simple_form documentation, and when you're done, add it to the bottom of the gemfile and run bundle. 
https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form

./gemfile.rb
gem 'simple_form'

bundle

Step 2
We have read the documentation, so we know we have to run the simple_form generator, and specify the use of bootstrap.

rails g simple_form:install --bootstrap

Step 3
And save our work, commit it to Github.

git commit -m "Installed Simple Form"
